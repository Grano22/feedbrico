## üß© Implementation considerations/notes

* To implement professional-grade CQRS I can use an Axon framework, but it is designed for large-scale applications, so I picked a built-in Spring application event listener and publisher.
* To sync read storage with writing storage, I can use an Inbox/Outbox pattern, but it's more time-consuming, so I resigned from it. I passed data from a model as byte array payload.
* Ideally would have something like sequence id or temporal stamp to avoid synchronizing old state after new or some in memory class that can use blocking queue to prioritize events. I resigned from it for simplicity.
